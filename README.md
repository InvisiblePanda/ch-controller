*This is a work-in-progress*

The final state of this project is still not determined. For the moment, it is supposed to be a simple Clicker Heroes helper
for the Steam version of the game. As of now, it has a switchable idle mode, a broken "Ascend" button (I forgot to add Treebeast
and thus the coordinates are off), and a switchable AutoFire mode useful for an active style of playing or Immortal fights.
